```{r dataread, warning=F,message=F}
####-----Reading in Data and Stacking it ----- ####
#Reading in files
files <- list.files('../data',full.names=T)


#Read in individual data files
ndmi <- read_csv(files[1]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndmi')


ndsi <- read_csv(files[2]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndsi')

ndvi <- read_csv(files[3])%>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndvi')

# Stack as a tidy dataset
full_long <- rbind(ndvi,ndmi,ndsi) %>%
  gather(key='site',value='value',-DateTime,-data) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value))


```




## Question 1) 

What is the correlation between NDVI and NDMI? - here I want you to
convert the full_long dataset in to a wide dataset using the 
function "spread" and then make a plot that shows the correlation as a
function of if the site was burned or not (x axis should be ndmi)
You should exclude winter months and focus on summer months

```{r}
#make wide data format
full_wide <- spread(data=full_long,key='data',value='value')


  


```


## Question 2 

2) What is the correlation between average NDSI (normalized
 snow index) for January - April and average NDVI for June-August?
In other words, does the previous year's snow cover influence vegetation
 growth for the following summer?


## Q3

How is the snow effect from question 2 different between pre- and post-burn
and burned and unburned? 


## Question 4

What month is the greenest month on average? 




## Question 5) 

What month is the snowiest on average?


## Bonus Question: Redo all problems with `spread` and `gather` using modern tidyverse syntax. 


## Bonus Question: Use Climage Engine to pull the same data for the assignment, but updated with 2020/2021 data.
